The Tower of Hanoi or Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three pegs, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any peg. The puzzle starts with the disks neatly stacked in order of size on one peg, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another peg, obeying the following rules:
  * Only one disk may be moved at a time.
  * Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the pegs and sliding it onto another peg, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that peg.
  * No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
